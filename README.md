# Social Identity Status and Health in Sub-Saharan Africa

This is some analysis I did for my masters thesis using the Afrobarometer data. There are two analysis so far, one uses structural equation model to understand (kind of) causal direction. Another analysis looks at the hierarchical effects of regions and nations.

Social Identity is basically group membership. According to Social Identity Theory (SIT) some groups have higher status than other groups. Individuals will try to align themselves with the highest status group possible. My thought is that if individuals are in a low status group and can't move up stress response would be triggered that would manifest itself as physical and mental health problems. 

However, the data that I have are cross-sectional and there is no way to really test the causal claim that social identity status -> worse health. I use structural equation models (SEM) to test a series of different causal models to see which model best fits the data that I have.
